no-swayze-no-wayze
==================
This is a multi-function repository. First of all, it functions as a [website](ahubers.com/no-swayze-no-wayze). Additionally, it will perform data collection by querying Bing for pictures of Patrick Swayze. It then inserts these into a database. These data are used on the website as well as in the subdirectory titled R. There lies the final purpose, analysis on Patrick Swayze color images as well as generating two [Shiny applications](http://shiny.rstudio.com/), [SwayzeStreamApp](http://swayzeallthewayze.shinyapps.io/SwayzeStreamApp), and [SwayzeApp](http://swayzeallthewayze.shinyapps.io/SwayzeApp).  The remaining README will be divided specifically to these seperate purposes.
